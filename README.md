I've created a React (TypeScript) project for basic learning using Vite tools.

This project aims to provide practice with React fundamentals and building a web application similar to Linktree.

**Clone the project and set it up locally with the following command:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kagankuscu/LinkProfileApp.git
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd my-project
```

**Installation:**`

Once cloned, run the following command in your terminal to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Running the Project:

After installation, start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Deployment:**

To deploy the project to Netlify.com, you need to build it first:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a dist folder containing the optimized build files. Upload the contents of this folder to your Netlify project.

**Custom Domain:**

Netlify supports adding a custom domain. You can configure it through your Cloudflare account.

**Visit My Website:**

You can see the deployed version of the application at [kuscu.net.tr](www.kuscu.net.tr).
